However, missions separate those serving from their family and friends, leaving them in need of the Mission Presidency’s support. Mission Leadership can provide watchful care, informed council, and create inspired rules and guidelines for the missionaries under their protection.</p>

                            (Udo & Grilo, 2018).

                        <p class="text-muted">Women are more likely to struggle with eating disorders than men (Lipson et al., 2016). In their lifetime, women are 12 times more likely to have anorexia nervosa, 5.8 times more likely to have bulimia nervosa, and 3.01 times more likely to have binge eating disorder (Udo & Grilo, 2018).</p>

I had two companions in particular that would make a lot of comments about weight. I could tell that one of them was making it a silent competition between me and her to see who could eat less. She was also very passionate about exercise. Because of her comments, I knew she was worried about gaining weight on the mission. We never talked about it, but I think she might have had an eating disorder.</p></div>

                                        Eating disorders are severe and persistent eating behaviors connected to distressing thoughts and emotions. 
                                        There are many types of eating disorders, but the main disorders that we will focus on are anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). 
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        People with AN starve themselves. Those with BN switch between dieting and then binge eating high calorie foods. Individuals with BED eat large amounts of food in a short period of time and then feel like they lose control over what and how much they are eating.

                                    <p>Eating disorders do not only hinder a missionary's ability to find fulfillment on the mission, they also can hurt a missionary’s mental and physical health. For example, anorexia nervosa not only is associated with depressive disorder, it also predicts it. Research has also shown that suicide is a common cause of death among those with an eating disorders (Berkman et al., 2007). </p>

                                    <p>By analyzing and combining several studies on eating disorders, researchers found that some people who had anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or binge eating disorder experienced a range of negative outcomes, depending on their disorder. These byproducts included excess weight loss, weight regain, organ damage, mood disorders, major depression, anxiety, OCD, social phobia, substance abuse, and death (Berkman et al., 2007).</p>

                                    <p>On average, about half of the people who have struggled with an eating disorder in the last twelve months report that their disordered eating interferes with normal daily activities, results in serious problems with getting along with others, and contributes to serious problems with fulfilling responsibilities (Udo & Grilo, 2018). </p>
                                    <p>Eating disorders can also greatly impact one's ability to be productive and effective (Filipova et al., 2016). Because of these challenges, missions can be particularly difficult for young adults experiencing eating disorders. A mission is full of tight schedules, trying to work with new people, and learning new responsibilities.</p>

                                    <p>A pilot program performed on two university campuses found that more than half of the individuals who were overweight/obese were also high risk for an eating disorder. They explained that individuals who were overweight or obese were more likely to support binge eating and fasting, report that their eating disorder concerns hindered their social life and made them feel badly, and describe more weight/shape concerns (Kass, A.E. et al., 2017).</p>

                                    <p>However, it is important to remember that Weight is not always an accurate predictor. In a systematic review of literature, they found that about half of those with anorexia nervosa had a normal body weight (Berkman et al., 2007).</p>

                                    <p></p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Need for Control</p>
                                    <p>Young women have been found to practice disordered eating because they feel a lack of control. This could be as a reaction to the stress in their lives. When they feel like they can’t control scary things happening in their lives, they find comfort in controlling what they eat (Budd, 2007).</p>
                                    <p>Missionary life includes major eating changes for many missionaries because of a few factors, including the prevalence of meals fed by members of the church in local areas, where portion sizes are out of their control.</p>
                                    <p>Missionaries are also limited in the exercise they can do. Exercise can be done excessively, which is part of these disorders, but can also improve body satisfaction.</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Body Image</p>
                                    <p>Eating disorders are also connected to body image.  Having negative perceptions of one's body may lead to eating disorders (Ferreiro et al., 2011). It isn't the way that one actually looks, but the person's perceptions of their body size that predicts mental health problems (Al Mamun et al. 2007).</p>
                                    <p>Christian women can judge their bodies harshly. In a study done on eating disorders in Christian women, researchers found that Christian women were rated higher for body checking, which can lead to binge eating (Wilhelm, L., et al., 2018). Sister missionaries are immersed in a Christian culture and are encouraged to present themselves in a way that represents The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is possible that their expectations and beleifs affect the way they feel about their bodies.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Perfectionism</p>
                                    <p>Research has found that perfectionistic qualities are associated with eating disorders (Shafran et al., 2002). Many young women who choose to go on missions are high-achieving and come from families with high expectations. This can make them more likely to have perfectionistic tendencies.</p>

                                    <p></p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Lack of Social Support</p>
                                    <p>Young women have been found to practice disordered eating because they feel a lack of control and they need social support (Budd, 2007). Young women report that separating themselves from a dysfunctional source of social support or developing a healthy and close relationship helped them in their recovery from an eating disorder. Their stories emphasized the importance of distancing themselves from people who commented negatively about people's bodies or encouraged unhealthy eating behaviors.</p>

                                    <p></p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Cultural Pressure</p>
                                    <p>There is a lot of cultural pressure on missionaries to not gain weight. Missionaries are also told that they will unavoidably gain weight, which can be stressful. Members can pressure missionaries to eat more, and companions or family can make unhelpful comments on weight, creating a stressful environment.</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Hiding Behind Religious Practices</p>
                                    <p>Missionaries can also miss out on social support by hiding behind religious practices. For example, missionaries can easily skip meals under the disguise of "working hard." There can also be mission or companion expectations to skip meals for the sake of more efficient missionary work. Missionaries can also hide their disordered eating under the disguise of religious fasting.                                  Missionaries can also hide their disordered eating under the disguise of religious fasting.</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Stressful Environment</p>
                                    <p>The mission is a stressful time and could cause flare ups in disordered eating. Research has shown that those with bulimia nervosa experience a rise in sadness, guilt, and fear before they binge or purge (Berg et al., 2012). It is possible that sister missionaries use binging and purging as a way to cope with sadness, guilt and fear in their lives.</p>
                                    <p>Because adjusting to missionary life requires getting used to new cultures, creating relationships with companions and other members, and focusing on becoming a proper and hard-working missionary, missionaries can be in a particularly stressful environment that contributes to engaging in poor coping mechanisms like practicing bulimia nervosa.</p>
